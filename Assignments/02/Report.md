# Report
I am running this program on Blue.

I ran the program initially without changing anything and got the runtime: 2m3.464s

First attempt at threading: I'm pushing a commit with my first attempt at threading with commit message "first attempt at threading". I attempted to thread the program by dividing the vector of records into tenths and processing the values that way. When it doesn't segfault, I am getting a worse runtime, but thought it would be worthwile to still push my attempt.

Runtime with initial attempt at threading: 15m
