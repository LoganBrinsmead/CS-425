- The **initial time** I got with **no speedups** attempted was **4 minutes**

- After attempting a **speedup using basic threads with async operations**, AKA the "minimum viable product", the time was also **4 minutes** so no speedup here.

- Finally I **attempted a speedup with a ring buffer**. This resulted in a time of **3 minutes** before the server was done. Not a signifcant speedup, but a speedup nonetheless.
